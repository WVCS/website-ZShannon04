 <p> This game was probably influenced by Pokemon GO! I got it a week before making this and played it quite a bit. The situation kind of doesn't make sense, but oh well. 
    <br>
    The sprites in this game are all drawn by me, excluding the bowtie. Most of the sprites were already existing from a contest that I entered. Will update some more info later. also, pretty sure this css needs to be changed cuz i predict htis will look kinda outrageous </p>
